# Runtime-Analysis
This project was a part of my assignments for the Data Structures and Algorithm Class. I have analyzed the runtime complexity of different STL containers on various operations.
In this project, we will deal with four of the STL containers:
1. Array
2. Vector
3. Forward List
4. List
We will analyze runtimes of the aforementioned containers for performing the following functions:
1. Appending
2. Removing from End
3. Prepending
4. Removing from Front
5. Emptying
6. Swapping
7. Reversing
8. Inserting
9. Removing Duplicates    
We will measure the runtimes for each of the containers for executing each of the aforementioned functions
with varying numbers of elements. The number of elements assigned to these containers to measure their
runtimes will be 2n where n can take positive integers between 1 and 10 inclusive. To be more specific, the
size assigned to these containers will be in the range 2,4,8,16,32,. . . .,1024. For all the functions a trial run will
be executed so that unexpected values in runtimes that occur in the beginning can be avoided. The practical
runtimes that we have obtained will be compared to the theoretical runtimes of the different containers for
performing different functions. Both the practical and theoretical runtimes will be in the worst case scenario
unless otherwise specified. When the theoretical runtimes of different containers are projected to be the same,
different arbitrary slopes will be assigned to each containerâ€™s runtime line graph.
